From their sensible, poetic and tangible approach of interactive design, their projects try to empower users and cast a different light on the technology surrounding our daily lives.

## Description
**_Les métamorphoses de Mr. Kalia_ (M. Kalia metamorphosis) is an interactive poetic adventure and a study of the concept of metamorphosis, the natural capacity of animals to abruptly change their body structure. To explore this topic, we invite the audience to personify Mr. Kalia as he goes through many surrealistic metamorphoses.**

Human bodies also face many different kinds of abrupt changes : unique or recurring, biological or artificial, physical or psychological, caused or inflicted. As a reflection of these human 'metamorphoses', each phase that Mr. Kalia goes through, conveys feelings related to change, evolution and adaptation.

Mr. Kalia can be brought to life by any person from the audience through the use of a skeleton tracking technology. The application provides various interactions that give different possibilities in progressing through the story, and a unique animated experience each time.

Imagined with simplicity in mind, this interactive installation is targeted to a broad range of people and can be installed in a wide variety of places. Also accessible from a web browser, people can watch the resulting animations live.
